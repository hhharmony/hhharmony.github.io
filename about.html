			<h2 style="text-align: justify"><p style="line-height: 1cm; ">My name is Ania and I'm a highschool student in Poland. I decided to create this website after a pontoon rafting trip that I joined one sunny day in November. 
			 The previous weeks had been a very busy time form me. A break from the city rush was a true medicine for my nerves. 
			 The soothing splash of water and chirping of birds have inspired me to design a special place for anyone, who needs a moment of relaxation. This website is the result of my work. 
			 It contains a collection of recordings which are going to transfer your imagination to the world of lush forests and vast meadows. 
			 Grab your yoga mat or a good book and explore the amazing world of sounds with my recordings! I hope you'll enjoy it!</p></h2>
